- 6-5 What is the difference between a multidomestic marketing strategy and a global marketing strategy?<!-- {"fold":true} -->
  - Answer: Multinational firms view the world as consisting of unique markets.

## Ch. 7 Review Questions<!-- {"fold":true} -->
- 7-1 What is marketing research?<!-- {"fold":true} -->
  - Answer: Marketing research is the process of defining a marketing problem and opportunity, systematically collecting and analyzing information, and recommending actions to reduce the risk of and thereby improve marketing decisions.
- 7-2 What is the five-step marketing research approach?<!-- {"fold":true} -->
  - Answer: The five-step marketing research approach provides a sys-tematic checklist for making marketing decisions and actions. The five  steps  are:  (1)  define  the  problem,  (2)  develop  the  research plan, (3) collect relevant information (data), (4) develop findings, and (5) take marketing actions.
- 7-3 What are constraints, as they apply to developing a research plan?<!-- {"fold":true} -->
  - Answer: Constraints in a decision are the restrictions placed on potential solutions to a problem, such as time and money. These set the parameters for the research plan—due dates, budget, and so on
- 7-4 What is the difference between secondary and primary data?<!-- {"fold":true} -->
  - Answer:  Secondary  data  are  facts  and  figures  that  have  already been recorded prior to the project at hand, whereas primary data are facts and figures that are newly collected for the project.
- 7-5 What are some advantages and disadvantages of secondary data?<!-- {"fold":true} -->
  - Answer: Advantages of secondary data are the time savings, the low cost, and the greater level of detail that may be available. Dis-advantages of secondary data are that the data may be out of date, unspecific, or have definitions, categories, or age groupings that are wrong for the project.
- 7-6 What is the difference between observational and questionnaire data?<!-- {"fold":true} -->

(b)  Figure  7-6D  shows  a finding (the decline in pizza consumption) that leads to a recom-mendation to develop an ad targeting children 6 to 12 years old (the marketing action).
- 7-10 In  evaluating  marketing  actions,  what  are  the  two  dimensions  on which they should be evaluated?<!-- {"fold":true} -->
  - Answer: There are two aspects marketers use to evaluate the results of  marketing  actions:  (1)  evaluate  the  decision  itself,  which  in-volves monitoring the marketplace to determine if action is neces-sary in the future, and (2) evaluate the decision process used to determine (a) whether the marketing research and analysis used to develop  the  recommendations  were  effective  or  flawed  in  some way and (b) whether the process could be improved for similar situ-ations in the future.
- 7-11 What are the three kinds of sales forecasting techniques?<!-- {"fold":true} -->

## Ch. 8 Review Questions<!-- {"fold":true} -->
- 8-1 Market segmentation involves aggregating prospective buyers into groups that have two key characteristics. What are they?<!-- {"fold":true} -->
  - Answer: The groups should (1) have common needs and (2) respond similarly to a marketing action.
- 8-2 In terms of market segments and products, what are the three mar-ket segmentation strategies?<!-- {"fold":true} -->
  - Answer:  The  three  market  segmentation  strategies  are:  (1)  one product and multiple market segments; (2) multiple products and multiple market segments; and (3) “segments of one,” or mass cus-tomization—the next step beyond build-to-order.
- 8-3 The process of segmenting and targeting markets is a bridge between which two marketing activities?<!-- {"fold":true} -->
  - Answer: identifying market needs and executing the marketing program
- 8-4 What  is  the  difference  between  the  demographic  and  behavioral bases of market segmentation?<!-- {"fold":true} -->
  - Answer:  Demographic  segmentation  is  based  on  some  objective physical (gender, race), measurable (age, income), or other classi-fication attribute (birth era, occupation) of prospective customers. Behavioral segmentation is based on some observable actions or attitudes by prospective customers—such as where they buy, what benefits they seek, how frequently they buy, and why they buy.
- 8-5 What factor is estimated or measured for each of the cells in a market-product grid?<!-- {"fold":true} -->
  - Answer: Each cell in the grid shows the estimated market size of a given product sold to a specific market segment.
- 8-6 What are some criteria used to decide which segments to choose for targets?<!-- {"fold":true} -->
  - Answer:  Possible  criteria  include  market  size,  expected  growth, competitive position, cost of reaching the segment, and compatibility with the organization’s objectives and resources.
- 8-7 How  are  marketing  and  product  synergies  different  in  a  market-product grid?<!-- {"fold":true} -->
  - Answer:  Marketing  synergies  run  horizontally  across  a  market-product grid. Each row represents an opportunity for efficiency in the marketing efforts to a market segment. Product synergies run vertically down the market-product grid. Each column represents an opportunity for efficiency in research and development (R&D) and production. Marketing synergies often come at the expense of product synergies because a single customer segment will likely re-quire a variety of products, each of which will have to be designed and manufactured. The company saves money on marketing but spends more on production. Conversely, if product synergies are emphasized, marketing will have to address the concerns of a wide variety of consumers, which costs more time and money.
- 8-8 What  is  the  difference  between  product  positioning  and  product repositioning?<!-- {"fold":true} -->
  - Answer: Product positioning refers to the place a product occupies in consumers’ minds based on important attributes relative to com-petitive  products.  Product  repositioning  involves  changing  the place a product occupies in a consumer’s mind relative to competi-tive products.
- 8-9 Why  do  marketers  use  perceptual  maps  in  product  positioning decisions?<!-- {"fold":true} -->
  - Answer: Perceptual maps are a means of displaying in two dimen-sions the location of products or brands in the minds of consum-ers. Marketers use perceptual maps to see how consumers perceive competing  products  or  brands  as  well  as  their  own  product  or brand.  Then  they  can  develop  marketing  actions  to  move  their product or brand to the ideal position.
